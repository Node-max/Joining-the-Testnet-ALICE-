# How to Join Alice

1) Running the Node
-  **Before installing a Muon node, one needs to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server). To do so, you can use Install Docker Engine, where you should first choose your server's operating system, and then follow the installation instructions. 
- **The first step is to get the Muon docker-compose.yml : 
```pyton
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muon-protocol/muon-node-js/testnet/docker-compose-pull.yml
```
